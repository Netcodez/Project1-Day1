# Project1-Day1
dataTypes function, getPrimes  function,  OOP model and tests
Day 1 Self Clinic

Write a function called *dataTypes* to compare and return results, based on the argument supplied to the function. Follow through the test to produce the perfect function that accounts for all expectations.
For strings, return its length.
For null or undefined return string ‘no value’
For booleans return the boolean
For numbers return a string showing how it compares to hundred e.g. For 67 return ‘less than 100’ for 4034 return ‘more than 100’ or equal to 100 as the case may be
For arrays return the 3rd index, or undefined if it doesn’t exist.
For functions call the function and pass in true as an argument and return it



Write a *getPrimes* function that takes an integer value n as argument and generates prime numbers from 0 to n with asymptotic analysis.
The generated prime numbers should be in an array.
If no prime number is obtainable for the input, return an empty array.
Your logic should be as efficient as possible (with minimal iterations).
Your code should also address edge cases (invalid input, negative input value, or zero as input).
```    Please write your own Jasmine tests with at least 5 test cases.```



CHOOSE AN OOP IMPLEMENTATION, THEN WRITE YOUR OWN CODE AND TESTS
